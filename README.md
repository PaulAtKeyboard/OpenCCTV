# OpenCCTV
Basic web GIS of Auckland CCTV Network

## Concept
Auckland Transportation (AT) has their CCTV network publicaly avaiable. We are going to map all the cameras.

## Data
We found the data online via a Radio New Zealand article. We believe someone requested the data under the Local Government Official Information and Meetings Act (LGOIMA) 1987.
